        <p>Sorry, the game is not playable in a mobile format. Instead, you can play this tic tac toe game that I
            created. <br>
            <br>Make sure to jump on a Mac or Windows machine and download the game file there!

        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>I have been playing around with a game where you combine the heart and soul of characters while running away
            from shadow enemies!
            The game is still being worked on because the art isn't quite what I would like yet. I just started using
            the Adobe Creative Suite in a Visual Media Class
            so I'm learning to make my characters a lot better than the AI generated png files that they are now.
            I will update these files when I improve the images and the gameplay!
